# PF

This is my very first code in **React.JS** technology. It is project for [React Girls](https://reactgirls.com/) mentoring competition. You can use it for your PF wishes:

1. You can edit URL with additional parameter ```?name={YOUR_NAME}``` or
2. Share this PF dynamically to **Facebook**, when your name will be automatically added to the URL.
